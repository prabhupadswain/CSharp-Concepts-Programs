# About Inheritance

# Inheritance

1. Inheritance is one of the pillars of OOPS concept.

2. Inheritance is the concept where one class say B, derives/extends or inherits the properties/methods from another class say A. As per this terminology, class A is parent/base class & class B is child/derived class respectively.

3. Just like in real world, a child may inherit some attributes & behaviour (personality traits) of his/her parent, based on this real world model, the concept of Inheritance is based, where a child class can derives/extends/modifes already present properties/attributes & methods/behaviour of its parent class.

4.  Since, in the real world, a child may inherit some attributes & behaviour of its parent, so this concept of OOPS in programming world is called as Inheritance. Since, the concepts of OOPS are based on real world objects, this concept of Inheritance is based on this real world scenario of child inheriting personality based on its parent.

5. Other terms for Parent Class is also known as Base Class & for Child Class is called as Derived Class.

6. Inheritance concept is based on Is-A relationship. For eg, 

a) A child Is-A son of his father and mother.
b) A child Is-A daughter of her father and mother.

c) A car Is-A vehicle.
d) A bike Is-A vehicle.

e) An employee Is-A human.
f) A student Is-A human.



# Advantages of Inheritance

1. Inheritance allows to make code re-use. Several common properties/attributes & methods/behaviour may be used in the Base/Parent class & only the specific properties & methods may be used in the specific child classes. 
 
2. The child class/derived class re-uses already defined properties(attributes)/methods(behaviour) of its parent class/base class with flexibility of creating its own class based on existing class and modifying itself by adding newer attributes & methods specific to itself. 

# Types of Inheritance

1. Single-level Inheritance.
2. Multi-level Inheritance.
3. Heirarchial Inheritance.
4. Multiple Inheritance.

We will see an example of each type of inheritance in this repository except the multiple inheritance which is not supported by C# but it is available through interfaces in C#.
